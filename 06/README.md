# Flexbox Alignment and Centering with justify-content

## justify-content
- flex-start
    - Items start from the lhs of the main axis
- flex-end
    - Items start from the rhs of the main axis
- center
    - Items start from the center of the main axis
- space-between
    - Items spread out along the main axis and have equal spacing between them
- space-around
    - Almost same as space-between, but it also takes in account the extreme left and right items.
