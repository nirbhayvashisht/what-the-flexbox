# Flexbox Alignment and Centering with align-content

## align-content
- By default it is align-content:stretch

- flex-start
    - Items start from the top of the cross axis
- flex-end
    - Items start from the bottom of the cross axis
- center
    - Items start from the center of the cross axis
- space-between
    - Items spread out along the cross axis and have equal spacing between them
- space-around
    - Almost same as space-between, but it also takes in account the extreme top and bottom items.


## to center an item, we can 
- align-content: center;
    - this will center them vertically
and
- justify-content: center;
    - this will center them horizontally
